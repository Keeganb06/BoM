          <p style="text-align: center;">The bakery is still dark when the bakers arrive. They turn on the lights and start to prepare the dough for baking. <br>
            The air is filled with the smell of yeast and flour. The bakers work quickly and efficiently, kneading the dough, shaping it, and placing it in the ovens.
            As the ovens heat up, the bakery starts to come to life. The smell of baking bread <br> fills the air, and the sound of the ovens humming can be heard. Customers 
            start to trickle in, drawn by the smell <br> of fresh bread. They browse the selection of pastries and cakes, and chat with the bakers about the day's specials.
            <br> By the time the bakery opens its doors, it is filled with the hustle and bustle of morning activity. Customers are buying bread, pastries, and coffee, and the 
            bakers are busy filling orders. <br> The bakery is a warm and inviting place, and it is a great way to start the day.</p>
